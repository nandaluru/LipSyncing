# Architecture 

The architecture adopts a novel approach to achieve accurate lip-sync by leveraging a well-trained lip-sync expert. In contrast to previous methods relying on reconstruction loss or GAN-based setups with discriminator training, we employ a pre-trained discriminator already proficient in detecting lip-sync errors. Fine-tuning this discriminator on generated faces with noise reduces its capacity to measure lip-sync, influencing the quality of generated lip forms.

1. **Requirements:**
   - Prepare a base video that requires lip-syncing.
   - Obtain an audio file in any language for mimicking.

2. **Process:**
   - Simply provide the base video and the audio file to achieve lip sync.
